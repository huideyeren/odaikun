    ``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

    The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

    A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

    It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
    Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
